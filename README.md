## The Silver Tsunami

The goal of this project is to prepare Bobby's manager for the "silver tsunami" of employees reaching retirement age. 
To do this, the project will consist of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report.

Deliverable 1 involves creating a table of the most recent job titles held by employees born between 1952 and 1955, 
and counting the number of retirement-age employees by job title. The data for this deliverable will be taken from 
the Employees and Titles tables in the database, and will only include current employees (i.e., those whose "to_date" 
field is set to '9999-01-01').

Deliverable 2 involves identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The criteria 
for eligibility are as follows: the employee must be a current employee, they must have held their current job title 
for at least one year, and they must have at least one year of service with the company. The data for this deliverable
will be taken from the Employees and Titles tables in the database.

Deliverable 3 Analysis
The "silver tsunami" is a term that has been used to refer to the demographic trend of increasing numbers of older 
people in the population, particularly those over the age of 65. This trend has been referred to as a "tsunami" 
because it is seen as a sudden and overwhelming influx of older people into the population, similar to the way a 
tsunami is a sudden and overwhelming influx of water. The term is often used to refer to the potential challenges 
and opportunities that this demographic trend presents for society, including issues related to healthcare, retirement, 
and intergenerational relationships. In the context of the data analysis project described in the prompt, the "silver 
tsunami" appears to refer specifically to the increasing number of older employees who are reaching retirement age and 
leaving the workforce.

According to the data provided in this assignement there is an overwhelming amount PH employees retiring soon accross 
the company.
